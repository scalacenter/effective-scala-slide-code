Most of the examples are provided as self-contained worksheets
that you can just open in your IDE.

There are also a few Scala projects with their own entry points.
You can run them with the following command:

~~~ shell
sbt run
~~~

You should see the following prompt:

~~~ text
Multiple main classes detected. Select one to run:
 [1] org.epfl.sierpinski.collections
 [2] org.epfl.sierpinski.imperative
 [3] org.epfl.sierpinski.recursion
 [4] org.epfl.tasks.collections
 [5] org.epfl.tasks.recursion

Enter number: 
~~~

Enter the number of the entry point you want to run, and
press Enter.
